# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Stanislav HLukhan and I'm a frontend developer with experience in React.

## About Me

I have a passion for creating beautiful and responsive web interfaces. My main focus is on writing clean, maintainable, and reusable code that is easy to read and understand.

I recently completed a React course and gained experience building web applications with the library. In addition, I have 2 months of commercial experience working on a team of developers to build and deploy websites for clients.

## My Projects

### [Portfolio Website]

I created a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills and projects. The website is built with React and styled with CSS modules. You can view it [here](https://example.com).

### [Shopping Cart]

I built a shopping cart application with React and Redux. The application uses an API to fetch product data and allows users to add items to their cart and complete a purchase. You can view the code [here](https://github.com/username/shopping-cart).
